# Midnight Commander Solarized 

This is a skin for [Midnight Commander][1] using the [Solarized palette][2].   
It is designed to be used with terminal emulators that use Solarized palette as   
their [ANSI colors][3].   

It is a fork from nkulikov/mc-solarized-skin however it was rewriten from   
scratch based on [GoTaR][4] MC skin. The file highliting was adjusted to be as   
close as possible to the Solarized [dircolors.ansi-universal][5].   

Some info on skin writing is available on [MC wiki][6],   
yet it's usually takes a PHD to understand what's going on.   
And since I'm senile and lazy, I don't want to keep going to external references.   

Also, it seems it's bloody scattered all over the place, and one has to collect tiny,   
and I do mean TINY, and sometimes outdated, pieces of information to form something complete.   
That's why I took the libery to comment EVERYTHING, just in case.
